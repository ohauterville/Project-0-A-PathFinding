Hi 

You can either draw your maze or randomly generate blocks, you can choose the with the height and the size of the squares.

If you want to draw your maze put maximum 3 arguments exemple run:
    - python astar.py WIDTH HEIGHT SIZE
    - python astar.py WIDTH SIZE         ### will create a square

If the dimension are not good, not divisible integer they will be ignored.

If you want to generate a maze
    -python astar.py WIDTH HEIGHT SIZE DENSITY

Density is a float number between 0 and 1
